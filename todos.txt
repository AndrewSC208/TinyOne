Jquery Plug-ins to build and learn animations
1. Dropdown menu slide down and out to raveal nav menu.
2. Print out the main heading like a typewriter
3. Smooth scroll to each section when arrow clicked [add and up arrow when needed]

BUILD FROM THE SMALLEST MEDIA QUERY UP. SLOWLY SLIDE OPEN THE BROWSER WHEN THE SITE LOOKS LIKE CRAP THEN ADD A BREAK POINT. 

Todo's:
5. Fix the spacing for rest of the site
6. Fix the font size through out the whole site
	- make the headers for each section larger
7. Icon's for the features
8. Button size in the pricing section
9. Our work section should only have 2 in each row, for a total of 4 on the page
10. Our team should only be 3 wide.
11. Place holder text should be black for all forms and buttons
12. Maybe just 4 different features, 6 seems like to many 
13. I need to do something with the social icons, right now they are way to plan.
