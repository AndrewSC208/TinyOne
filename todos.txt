Jquery Plug-ins to build and learn animations
1. Dropdown menu slide down and out to raveal nav menu.
2. Print out the main heading like a typewriter
3. Bounce the arrow 
4. Smooth scroll to each section when arrow clicked [add and up arrow when needed]

BUILD FROM THE SMALLEST MEDIA QUERY UP. SLOWLY SLIDE OPEN THE BROWSER WHEN THE SITE LOOKS LIKE CRAP THEN ADD A BREAK POINT. 

Todo's:
1. Break-up main.scss files into smaller component size files
2. Fix the spacing for the landing page
3. Add the srinking nav animation.
4. Write the jquery plug-in's
5. Fix the spacing for rest of the site
6. Fix the font size through out the whole site
7. Icon's for the features
8. Button size in the pricing section
9. Our work section should only have 2 in each row, for a total of 4 on the page
10. Our team should only be 3 wide.
11. Place holder text should be black for all forms and buttons
12. Maybe just 4 different features, 6 seems like to many 
13. I need to do something with the social icons, right now they are way to plan.
